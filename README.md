# CrickInfo-Scrapper
CrickInfo Scrapper is a Javascript Project.I wrote a script using axios, jsdom, excel4node and pdf4lib which scraps WorldCup 2019 scorecards from official cricinfo site and stores that in excel sheets and pdf form. The purpose of writing this script was to get the data of every match in structured format and learn WebScrapping while having fun.
